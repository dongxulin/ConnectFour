In AddressBook.java
1. line 24, instead of using a specific class hashmap in the front, it is better to use a interface map to do this, like Map<Integer,Contact> addressList, which give us more flexibility.

2. It will look better if the author give one or two empty space between methods.

3.line 24, the list should be private for safety.

4. there should be space in both side of “=“ “+”, like in line 53,54,60. The author make no space.

5.some method does not handle the null case, and the javadoc does not mention this. like 
line 91, the remove method.

6.for the search method, it is better to use string as input argument rather than a contact.

7. it looks like using a hashmap for storing the contact does not make sense, the author does not tell what is the mapping relation here. A list can be used.

8.the toString method can be improved. It is good for debugging if it list all the contacts inside.

9.It may make sense to have equal and hashcode.



In Contact.java

1. some variable may need better naming, like ContactBuilder c, c is not a good name for a builder.

2. missing javadoc for public method like equal and toString.

3.some method cannot handle case that input is null

4. in line 67, getNumber method, instead of returning a null, it is better to return an empty string. because a null returned is more error prone.

5. in line 91, the constructor is redundant.

6. it is better to explain the difference between weak equals and equals using javadoc



In GeneralUtils.java

1. there are a lot of repeated code. like line 43, 51, 59. This can be write into a single method and call several times.

2. the try catch block is too wide in line 85, line 132, it is better to narrow down to the code where exception may happen and separate 2 kinds of exception.

3. the exportAddressBook method always return -1, in line 91,  which is confusing. It is better to return 1 if successful, -1 if fail.

4. in line 93, the return type of the method should be better set to map, instead of hash map. 

5. there is computer generated comment in line 86

6. in line 82, there are debug code which is comment out, it is not good for writing library.   // StreamResult result = new StreamResult(System.out);



In PhoneNumber.java

1. if this class is just a string, we can do it using a string type for phone number, this class looks redundant.

2. it override equals method without overriding hashcode method.
